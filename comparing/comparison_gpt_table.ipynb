    "    You are comparing two radiology reports in the section '{section_name}', where the content is provided as key-value pairs.\\n\\n\n",

    "    The input consists of observations represented as key-value pairs:\\n\n",
    "    In this comparison, the input for the Newer Report ({date1_str}) is: {section_content_1}\\n\n",
    "    and the input for the Older Report ({date2_str}) is: {section_content_2}\\n\\n\n",

    "    1. **Both Reports Are Empty:**\\n\n",
    "       - If there are no key-value pairs in both the Newer Report and Older Report, output *Both report sections are empty*.\\n\\n\n",
    "    2. **Newer Report is Empty, Older Report Has Key-Value Pairs:**\\n\n",

    "         - Categorize each key-value pair in the Older Report as **No Longer Mentioned**.\\n\n",
    "         - Use 'NIL' as the content for '{date1_str} Content'.\\n\n",
    "         - Use the values from the Older Report for '{date2_str} Content'.\\n\\n\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Comparison Instructions:\\n\n",
    "    Follow the step-by-step logic to compare the key-value pairs from the two reports:\\n\\n\n",
    "    1. **Comparison Flow:**\\n\n",
    "       - Compare each key in the Newer Report ({date1_str}) against all keys in the Older Report ({date2_str}).\\n\n",
    "       - Treat keys that are phrased **similarly** or refer to the same concept as being the **same key**.\\n\\n\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Categorization Logic:**\\n\n",
    "       - **CASE 1: Difference**\\n\n",
    "         - If a key in the Newer Report matches a key in the Older Report (or is phrased similarly):\\n\n",
    "           - Use the value from the Newer Report as '{date1_str} Content'.\\n\n",
    "           - Use the value from the Older Report as '{date2_str} Content'.\\n\n",
    "           - If the value from the Newer Report is the same or similar to the value of the Older Report (e.g., both values are 'Enlarged'): Categorized as **Difference**.\\n\\n\n",
    "           - Else, DO NOT categorise as **Difference** and move on to the next key-value pair in Newer Report.\\n\\n\n",
    "       - **CASE 2: New Development**\\n\n",
    "         - If the key in the Newer Report is **not present** in the Older Report (and no similar key exists):\\n\n",
    "           - Use the value from the Newer Report as '{date1_str} Content'.\\n\n",
    "           - Use 'NIL' for '{date2_str} Content'.\\n\n",
    "           - Categorize as **New Development**.\\n\\n\n",
    "       - **CASE 3: No Longer Mentioned**\\n\n",
    "         - After processing all keys from the Newer Report, check the Older Report for any unused key-value pairs.\\n\n",
    "           - For each unused key-value pair:\\n\n",
    "             - Use 'NIL' for '{date1_str} Content'.\\n\n",
    "             - Use the value from the Older Report as '{date2_str} Content'.\\n\n",
    "             - Categorize as **No Longer Mentioned**.\\n\\n\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Key Similarity Clarification:**\\n\n",
    "       - Keys that are similar in meaning or phrasing (e.g., 'Minor atelectasis' and 'Atelectasis (lung collapse)') must be treated as the **same key**.\\n\n",
    "       - These comparisons must always be categorized as **Difference** ONLY IF their values differ (e.g., both values are 'Enlarged').\\n\\n\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Output Format:**\\n\n",
    "    Do not output irrelevant text like: Here's the comparison of the two radiology reports following the provided logic, output only the table.\n",
    "    f\n",
    "    Present the comparison results in the following table format:\\n\"\n",
    "    | Category            | {date1_str} Content                      | {date2_str} Content                      | Explanation                         |\\n\n",
    "    |---------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\\n\n",
    "    | Difference          | {{Newer Report Value}}                   | {{Older Report Value}}                   | Explanation of the difference.      |\\n\n",
    "    | New Development     | {{Newer Report Value}}                   | NIL                                      | Explanation of new observation.     |\\n\n",
    "    | No Longer Mentioned | NIL                                      | {{Older Report Value}}                   | Explanation of removal or absence.  |\\n\\n\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Important Rules:\\n\n",
    "    1. Do **not** interpret or infer any information that is not explicitly stated in the provided key-value pairs.\\n\n",
    "    2. Treat similar keys as the **same key** and strictly follow the comparison flow and categorization rules.\\n\n",
    "    3. Use the exact wording from the reports for {date1_str} Content and {date2_str} Content.\\n\n",
    "    4. Make sure there is no duplication of entries across categories.\\n\\n\n",
